Capstone Project - Full-Stack E-commerce Website

This is the final project for my upGrad course, and I've selected the shopshopPlus project, which focuses on building an e-commerce website.
As someone who enjoys shopping, I often find myself using platforms like Blinkit and Amazon. This interest inspired me to explore this topic. In the future, I aim to develop my own shopping website, which would simplify our lives and allow us to focus on other essential aspects of life.
Hereâ€™s a guide to kick off the project:

Download all folders related to the admin client and server from the provided GitHub link. andBegin the setup process.
Configure Git for the project.

Fill the .env file in all three folders:

Register for account on Firebase. For the admin .env file, please fill in the following details:
REACT_APP_BASE_URL = 
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY = ""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN = ""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = ""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET = ""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = ""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID = ""

Register for account on Firebase. Next, complete the client .env file by entering the details below to match the admin .env file:
REACT_APP_API_URL=
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""

Register for accounts on cloudinary.com and MongoDB Atlas, then provide the following details:
PORT =
CLIENT_BASE_URL =
CONNECTION_STRING = ""
cloudinary_Config_Cloud_Name = ""
cloudinary_Config_api_key = ""
cloudinary_Config_api_secret = ""
JSON_WEB_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY = ""
 
Begin by starting the server, then proceed to launch the admin, and finally, open the client.

You have the freedom to design the website however you like, or you can choose to replicate the one provided in the link.
